/**
 * Asynchronously fetches contact information by ID.
 * 
 * This function sends an HTTP GET request to the server to retrieve detailed information of a specific contact based on the contact's ID.
 * It utilizes the axios library for making the HTTP request, and the request is asynchronous, allowing the use of `await` for easier result handling.
 * 
 * @param {string} id - The unique identifier of the contact. It is used to specify which contact's information needs to be retrieved.
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} Returns a promise that resolves to the data object containing the contact information.
 * 
 * Note: The function assumes that the `SERVER_URL` constant is defined elsewhere and contains the base URL of the server.
